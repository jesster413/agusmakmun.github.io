What is an awesome place you’ve visited?

*While I was working in Malaysia, I took a side trip to Singapore for a few days.  It was such a beautiful (and clean!) city with some of the most interesting architecture I've ever seen.  I'll never forget walking among the "supertrees" in the Gardens by the Bay and visiting the Flower Dome.*
