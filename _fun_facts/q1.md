What’s the best advice you’ve heard recently?

*You can keep getting older and get that certificate or keep getting older and don't, but regardless, you'll keep getting older.  

I originally heard this from a friend who was deciding whether to go back and finish his undergraduate degree in his thirties.  When deciding whether I should take GA's Data Science Immersive, I did the same thought experiment and realized that while some things are inevitable, there are other things that I do have control over.*
