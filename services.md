### Services
---

Jess is available for full-time and contract data science work in the consulting, enterprise, finance, and banking & compliance industries.  She also writes articles as a freelance data journalist.  Below is a list of her skills and services.  For more information about Jess' experience and qualifications or if you have a specific project that you would like to discuss, feel free to reach out directly to Jess using the [contact form](https://thedatasleuth.github.io/contact/).

### Data Analysis

Having large swaths of data is of no use to anyone if it can't be transformed into actionable insights.  Through exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques, Jess is able to identify and express the story hidden within the sea of information.  Specifically, Jess can write SQL queries that slice through databases like a machete through butter.  Her Python skills can tease out facts and trends with the dexterity of a surgeon.  She dreams of one day being a cattle rancher but until then is happy to wrangle some data.

### Predictive Modeling

["All models are wrong but some are useful."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box)  Jess strives to make her models more useful than others with advanced predictive modeling techniques like data imputation and enrichment, feature engineering, time series and geospatial analyses, and balancing under and over-represented classes.  She can implement a neural network with the [Keras](https://thedatasleuth.github.io/neural-network/keras/kaggle/2018/06/07/Intro-to-Keras.html) and TensorFlow libraries as well as execute decision-tree-based, gradient-boosted algorithms such as [XGBoost](https://thedatasleuth.github.io/xgboost/hackathon/2018/06/05/FastGoodCheap.html).

### Natural Language Processing

TL;DR?  Let Jess do it for you with Natural Language Processing techniques such as term frequency/inverse document frequency (TF/IDF) analysis, word vectorization, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis. Jess loves a good read and is familiar with popular NLP packages like nltk and gensim.  For a more in-depth look at how Jess has applied NLP techniques in the past, check out her [Reddit 'Hot' Posts](https://thedatasleuth.github.io/project/Reddit-Hot-Posts/) project in which she analyzed titles, posts, and associated comments of popular posts in Reddit.

### Web Scraping

More often than not, datasets do not come in neat packages from Kaggle - they have to be scraped and stitched together, sometimes from disparate sources.  Jess is well-versed in web scraping techniques that can pull data from the web and convert it into more manageable dataframes for further analysis.  You can see her web scraping techniques in her project on [SEC Filings](https://thedatasleuth.github.io/project/SEC-Filings/) during which she scraped the SEC's website for corporate filings and tried to predict enforcement actions.
