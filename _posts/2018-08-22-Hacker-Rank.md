*My answers to Challenges in Hacker Rank.*



<!--more-->

What is Hack Rank?
Hacker Rank is another great resource to improve programming and analysis skills.  There are many different modules and tutorials in which to practice skills.  Since SQL Zoo is temporarily down, I decided to give Hacker Rank a go.  

What can it offer? How is it different?

Hacker Rank motivates coders to continue improving their skills by rewarding successfully completed challenges with points that lead up to a badge.  There are multiple tiers of badges.  

There's also discussions for each challenge question where coders can ask questions related to the challenge and post their answers.  I've found this particularly helpful when I was stuck on a small aspect of the challenge.  

Below is a series of posts containing my answers to challenges rated at medium difficulty for the SQL series.
