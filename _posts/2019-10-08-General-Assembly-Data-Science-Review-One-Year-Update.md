*An honest review of General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course, one year later.*

<!--more-->

It's been a little over a year since I graduated from General Assembly's Data Science Immersive bootcamp and given some of the feedback I've received as a result of writing that post, I thought it might make sense to provide an update on how things have been going

what do i want to say:

i want to talk about my job update and how i got the job

i want to talk about what the job actually was

what are my headers
  - how i got the job - link to the 5 ways to get a job post
  - what my expectations were
  - what reality was
  - was my criticisms are
  - my new job and what the bootcamp meant for that
  - more stuff 

this post is supposed to be a review of GA - so i should offer criticism about what worked for me and what fell short of my expectations

main takeaway is that SQL was not taught in any meaningful way and yet, that was the majority of my job

in my initial review of the course, I was frustrated with the emphasis on Bayesian statistics - at the time it felt overly academic for what the job market actually demands. In the year since graduating, I still feel this way. In my experience, jobs that would likely demand knowledge of statistics would likely go to applicants with PhDs in statistics - and many jobs out there specify wanting a PhD. And this makes sense - what job would want someone to conduct high level statistics on their data sets with only a week's worth of statistical knowledge?

On the flip side, my first job out of bootcamp was heavy on the SQL for which I was largely unprepared for. As a result, the first 6 months were rough and I had to learn a large portion of my job on the job - this did not exactly inspire confidence in my supervisors that I went to an analytics bootcamp and struggled to put together a query.

Talk here about dynamic sql

What was more shocking to me is that my unit was frequently using dynamic SQL which I didn't even know existed. I thought I was doing ok with joins and nested select statements, but the idea that there was a whole other secret menu to SQL blew my mind.

It's also just a different thing between knowing how to use a join in theory and applying it on the job - say more here about what i mean.

i think i want to say that most jobs don't require machine learning but it's the sexy thing to teach and so they teach it, neglecting real world skills like SQL and looping through folders and shit

want to say that GA has to make the course sexy in order to sell it for 16k+ - no one is going to pay that kind of money to learn SQL

want to also note that my machine learning skills did likely get me in the door at my new role
