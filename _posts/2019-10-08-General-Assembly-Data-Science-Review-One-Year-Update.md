##Introduction - saying here why i'm doing this thing

It's been a little over a year since I graduated from General Assembly's Data Science Immersive bootcamp in Q2 of 2018, so I thought it might be a good time to give an update on my progress. Since writing the post, I received a number of messages on how useful the post was in their own decision to enroll in a bootcamp. They asked questions like XYZ. I'm so pleased that my review helped others, so I thought it would be a good idea to revisit my review with my updated thinking having worked in the industry now for a over a year.

When I wrote my initial review, I wrote it immediately after graduating and had yet to secure my first job in the industry. My review focused on the content of the course as well as my overall experience of the bootcamp - I had to write the part about how the course (and I) fit into the data science market. Having worked in the field for a little over a year now and gone through several rounds of interviews at various companies, I can affirm the ways in which the GA's coding bootcamp delivered on their promise to me as well as identify a few ways in which the bootcamp can be improved.

in my initial review of the course, I was frustrated with the emphasis on Bayesian statistics - at the time it felt overly academic for what the job market actually demands. In the year since graduating, I still feel this way. In my experience, jobs that would likely demand knowledge of statistics would likely go to applicants with PhDs in statistics - and many jobs out there specify wanting a PhD. And this makes sense - what job would want someone to conduct high level statistics on their data sets with only a week's worth of statistical knowledge?

##How I got my job

--first point of criticism here is that the bootcamp did not exmphasize coding challenges enough, mention here again about the career counseling, importance of conceptualizing a brand, building out this blog to serve as my portfolio - all that is good. but another key component of landing a job is being able to complete coding challenges on the spot - this is a very different skill

Because I wasn't working a full time job, and, as a result not bringing in any money, I knew I needed to start my job search early. Around week 5, I was already networking with former coworkers and sending my resume into LinkedIn job listings. In weeks 6 and 7, I was fielding a few phone interviews. In week 9, I landed an onsite final round interview. (Talk here about what I did prepare for the interview to include working on my pitch, practicing coding exercises, and practicing a case study, reading the LinkedIn interview questions). That job prospect did not end up working out for me, but I don't regret starting my job search while in class.

It encouraged me to continue reaching out to former coworkers and professional contacts to let them know that I updated my skillset and that I was looking for work in this new field.

Interview for a job is a lot like dating. When making initial contact, you have to strike a delicate balance between sincere interest and a casual confidence. You want to communicate to your prospective employer that you're deeply interested in the job without coming across as desperate or lacking in prospects. It's only a human feeling to want someone who's wanted by other people.

Two points of criticism:

Coding Challenges

1. I wish we did more interview coding challenges - there was no formal time set aside to practice coding interviews. We could (and should have) been practicing how to approach coding interviews in the very first week. Because as much as it's fun to build out machine learning models and improve them for weeks on end, the majority of the students are there to break into the industry and find a job. Nearly every job I've applied to since bootcamp has involved an on-site or paired coding challenge. It would have been incredibly helpful to simulate that experience from the beginning instead of waiting until the end of the bootcamp.


##What was it like to be at the job - did my skills translate

I had no expectations that I would be coding advanced machine learning models in my first job out of bootcamp - those types of jobs are typically reserved for PhDs, although I don't think it's impossible (or even unlikely) that bootcamp grads can secure these highly technical and coveted position with time. Job experience holds significant weight in the market, and at many tech relevant professional experience can outweigh formal degrees.



More sql

2. SQL is not the sexiest programming language out there. Talk here about when it was created and possibly some stats about its pervasiveness. Regardless, SQL is still widely used in many industries, and my first job out of bootcamp was no different.

While we did spend some time learning SQL at the very end of bootcamp, we did not cover nearly as much material as would have been helpful. We practiced some joins and where clauses and having statements, but it would have been much more helpful to practice actual challenges and exercises.

Moreover, we didn't learn any dynamic SQL or system administration.


On the flip side, my first job out of bootcamp was heavy on the SQL for which I was largely unprepared for. As a result, the first 6 months were rough and I had to learn a large portion of my job on the job - this did not exactly inspire confidence in my supervisors that I went to an analytics bootcamp and struggled to put together a query.

Talk here about dynamic sql

What was more shocking to me is that my unit was frequently using dynamic SQL which I didn't even know existed. I thought I was doing ok with joins and nested select statements, but the idea that there was a whole other secret menu to SQL blew my mind.

It's also just a different thing between knowing how to use a join in theory and applying it on the job - say more here about what i mean.

##Conclusions

So what does this mean for bootcamp grads looking to get their foot in the door of the data analytics industry? Treat your career as you would any data science project! Here's a few suggestions I've used in my own job search that has helped me so far:
  1. Secure a minimum viable product - While the job market is hot for data science and analytics skills right now, many companies are still very wary of hiring bootcamp grads. The perception is that bootcamp grads know only possess a surface knowledge of technical expertise compared to their Computer Science undergraduate counterparts. And, in part, they're not wrong - it's unreasonable to think that someone who went through a 12 week bootcamp has the same level of depth of understanding and technical prowess as someone who spent four years of undergrad studying computer science. But you also don't need to have majored in Stats and crafted a bespoke machine learning library to be successful in an analytics job. The hardest part of breaking into the data science industry, or any industry for that matter, is securing that first job. Once you're in,

  But that doesn't mean that bootcamp grads can't get to that same level of technical ability or depth of understanding. And in fact, many of the students that I went through bootcamp with did hold a quantitative degree(s).

  It *will* be difficult to get your foot in the door, but don't worry. This is the hardest part. After securing your first job in the data analytics industry, you're now working in the industry, and there's a huge difference between trying to break into something and being a part of it. Plus, once you're in...
  2. Learn, learn, learn
  3. Tune the parameters
  4. Iterate over the model - Once you have a minimum viable product, you can continuously iterate over your model with as much time, money, and energy you can afford. That deadline could be reaching a certain level or title within a defined time period. It could also mean wanting to reach a certain income and working your way back.




i think i want to say that most jobs don't require machine learning but it's the sexy thing to teach and so they teach it, neglecting real world skills like SQL and looping through folders and shit

want to say that GA has to make the course sexy in order to sell it for 16k+ - no one is going to pay that kind of money to learn SQL, and yet, that is a skill that is prevalent throughout the market, regardless industry or domain knowledge.

want to also note that my machine learning skills did likely get me in the door at my new role - mention Databricks and the sheer breadth of material taught

mention that going through the bootcamp demonstrates to employers that you are capable of learning new things - because you're always going to be learning new things in this industry and it's important to be flexible
