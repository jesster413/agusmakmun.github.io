*Answers to Hacker Rank challenges in the SQL module.*

<!--more-->

Hacker Rank is another great resource to improve programming and analysis skills offering modules like "Problem Solving", "Language Proficiency", and "Specialized Skills".  Within each module there is a topic, so for example, within the Language Proficiency module, there are seven languages to practice, including Python, Java, and Ruby.  Programmers can work through a series of challenges to improve their proficiencies, earning points that eventually accumulate to badges.  Bronze, silver, and gold badges represent what proficiency a programmer has within a given topic.  You may wonder why someone would care about achieving a badge that isn't seemingly worth anything, but this is actually another great way to showcase coding ability to prospective employers.  Demonstrating that you've achieved a gold badge in SQL on Hacker Rank is a quantifiable data point that corroborates bullet points on a resume.  

Within each challenge, there is a discussion section where coders can ask questions and post answers.  I've found this particularly helpful when I was stuck on a small aspect of the challenge or to identify alternative methods of approaching the problem.  

Below is a series of posts containing my answers to challenges rated at medium difficulty for the SQL module.
