*An honest, post-graduation review of General Assembly's 12-week Data Science Immersive course*

<!--more-->

General Assembly bills itself as a leader in Education.  Founded in 2011, GA claims to have "transformed tens of thousands of careers through pioneering, experiential education in todayâ€™s most in-demand skills"[^1] such as data science, web development, and user-experience design.  GA offers a wide range of classes and workshops, from 2-hour info sessions to 3-month, full time immersion courses.

My first introduction to General Assembly was in early 2017 when I enrolled in their [Excel](https://generalassemb.ly/education/excel-bootcamp/new-york-city) and [SQL](https://generalassemb.ly/education/sql-bootcamp-series/new-york-city) bootcamps.  These workshops were either one (Excel) or two-day (SQL) accelerated overviews of the respective tools.  

After six hours in the Excel bootcamp, I actually was able to walk away with a much better understanding of conditional statements, formulas, and pivot tables and was able to implement the techniques I learned in the class to my job immediately.  The SQL class also helped, but I wasn't able to practice writing queries as much after the class.

But as the months went by, I had a lingering feeling that if I wanted to advance my career in any kind of meaningful way, I needed harder-to-obtain skills than knowing how to write some formulas or manipulate some pivot tables.  In the year prior up to enrolling in GA's Data Science Immersive course, I kept returning to the curriculum in which GA promised to teach its students the fundamentals of machine learning in 12 weeks.  I was frustrated with how stagnant and limited my skillset was at my current job and concerned with my ability to advance beyond a lower-mid level role.  I wanted to take on more interesting (and analytical) projects but was routinely overlooked in favor of someone with more technical skills.

For about a year, I kept returning to that curriculum, nervous about how I could possibly swing taking three (plus) months off of work while living in NYC, and more nervous about what would happen if I didn't.

## Orientation Day

What GA (and any other bootcamp for that matter) proposes to accomplish is somewhat of an impossible task: Take students from varying backgrounds, skillsets, and aptitudes and teach a wide breadth of new and complicated material in what ends up being a sprint to the finish line every single week.  My cohort was no different.  At one end of the academic spectrum, a student decided to matriculate through the bootcamp in lieu of going to college.  On the other, there was a student who had tripled majored in math, physics, and philosophy at Yale.  There were students who had had professional experience as data analysts and were looking to advance their careers in their established fields and there were those that were looking to transition from completely unrelated industries.  The majority of the class had their Bachelor's degree, but a healthy amount also had Master's.  Our student had a Ph.D in Statistics along with our instructor, who had been a (very gifted) student in a few cohorts before us held a Ph.D in Physics.  About half of the class had majored in Math or a hard Science.  This is all to say, while it was a diverse cohort, many of my fellow students were quantitatively inclined.

## Syllabus

The Data Science course is taught simultaneously across the U.S. divided into two sections - East Coast and West Coast using a "connected classroom" format.  Using a video call, a global instructor would teach the lecture material to all five of the East locations (New York, Boston, DC, Atlanta, and Austin) and then turn around and teach the material to the West Coast cohort.  

Talk here about the layout of the course - like how we were grouped by East and West and the global/local layout.

I included a diagram of the schedule (seen below) from GA's website because it more or less describes how class was run.  (NB: While the course material is the same across the different locations, the overall experience of the course varies slightly based on the local instructor, the makeup of the class, and class-time restrictions mandated at the state level.  Because I am based in New York and took the course in New York, this post only describes my experience in that location.)

We began lecture promptly at 10 AM with one of our four global instructors who taught the material via a video call.  While we were not the first cohort to experience the "connected classrooms", it was still a new concept.  At first,

The concept of the connected classrooms was that a global instructor would teach the main lecture material to the five locations at the same time.  Surprisingly, it was fairly easy to engage with the lecturer via a dedicated Slack channel.  During lecture, students would pose questions on Slack and either the global instructor would answer them on the spot or, more often, lecture would continue while the local instructors, who were in the classroom with us, would answer them via Slack.  If you think this sounds like there was a lot happening all of the time during lecture, you're right.  There were multiple topic-related side discussions going on at once during lecture that you could choose to follow.  (They were almost always related to a spin-off question posed during lecture.)  

This was my first time using Slack, but I soon learned to love it because it allowed me to go back and review a written record of the lecture, and specifically, answers to questions that I may not have fully understood the first time around.

## Meet the Instructors

There were four global instructors, all with impressive credentials.

A review of the local instructor here.


Need to talk about the connected classrooms concept.

talk about multiple Slack channels.

Then talk about Outcomes

We also had a weekly Outcomes meeting every Thursday afternoon during which we discussed topics related to our pending job searches.

In addition to our weekly homework assignments and bi-weekly projects, we were also required to hand-in weekly "Outcomes" assignments, including Brand Statements, updated resumes, LinkedIn profiles, and written responses to questions like, "Tell me about yourself."
