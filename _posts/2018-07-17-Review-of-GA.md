*An honest, post-graduation review of General Assembly's 12-week Data Science Immersive course*

<!--more-->

General Assembly bills itself as the XYZ of the XYZ.  Founded in 201X, it claims to have done XYZ.  

My first introduction to General Assembly was through their Excel and SQL bootcamps, a one or two-day overview which served as shotgun approaches to each platform.  The Excel bootcamp worked pretty well, I thought, given that I was actually able to immediately implement the techniques I learned in the class to my job as a consultant.

But as the months went by, I had a lingering feeling that if I wanted to advance my career in any kind of meaningful way, I needed harder-to-obtain skills than knowing how to manipulate some Excel Pivot Tables.  I began to research their Data Science curriculum, where GA promised to teach its students the fundamentals of machine learning in 12 weeks.  For about a year, I kept returning to that curriculum, conducting the necessary thought experiments about what it would mean to me before shelling out about $16,000.  

Maybe some stats on Data Scientist?  Maybe a graph?  Maybe talk about demand?

What GA (and any other bootcamp for that matter) proposes to accomplish is somewhat of an impossible task: Take students from varying backgrounds, skillsets, and aptitudes and teach a wide breadth of new and complicated material in what ends up being a sprint to the finish line every single week.  My cohort was no different.  At one end of the academic spectrum, a student decided to matriculate through the bootcamp in lieu of going to college.  On the other, there was a student who had tripled majored in math, physics, and philosophy at Yale.  There were students who had had professional experience as data analysts and were looking to advance their careers in their established fields and there were those that were looking to transition from completely unrelated industries.  The majority of the class had their Bachelor's degree, but a healthy amount also had Master's.  Our student had a Ph.D in Statistics along with our instructor, who had been a (very gifted) student in a few cohorts before us held a Ph.D in Physics.  About half of the class had majored in Math or a hard Science.  This is all to say, while it was a diverse cohort, many of my fellow students were quantitatively inclined.

First talk about the academics

Then talk about Outcomes

We also had a weekly Outcomes meeting every Thursday afternoon during which we discussed topics related to our pending job searches.

In addition to our weekly homework assignments and bi-weekly projects, we were also required to hand-in weekly "Outcomes" assignments, including Brand Statements, updated resumes, LinkedIn profiles, and written responses to questions like, "Tell me about yourself."
