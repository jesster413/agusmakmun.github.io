*The search for a job can be exhausting, frustrating, and perplexing, even in a field as hot as data science is right now.  To get some actual traction with employers, don't do what everyone else does.  Here are five ways to look for a data-oriented job that can actually connect you to a hiring manager.*

We've all been there before.  You see a job on an aggregator site like Monster, Glassdoor, or Indeed that matches your interests and skillset.  You fill out basic demographic information about yourself and upload your resume.  Maybe you attach a general cover letter, maybe you don't.  Who even reads those things anymore anyway, you wonder.  You click the "Apply" button at the bottom of the screen and feel temporarily productive about the state of your job search and the acceleration of your career only to never hear back from the company - not even to acknowledge they've received your application.  You do this about a hundred more times, expecting different results.

While unemployment is at some all time lows for the past decade as of the writing of this post, it still remains extremely difficult to land a good job, even for an industry as hyped as Data Science.  Hundreds if not thousands of candidates for a single job posting, many of whom have advanced degrees and years of professional and *relevant* job experience.  Anecdotally speaking, I have been that person to take the "shot-gun" approach to job applications.  In one day, I applied to over 20 jobs that were entry level data science jobs (so within my reach) and I got exactly 0 invitations for a phone screen, let alone an actual in-person interview.  It was then that I decided to switch up my job search strategy because *feeling* productive is not always the same thing as actually generating solid leads.  Here's a few of the strategies that I've used in my own job search that have connected me to actual human beings who've had a genuine interest in speaking to me about a job that actually exists.



### Slack Channels

Slack is a new platform for what now feels like an old concept: a common interest chatroom.  Companies use slack for internal communications.  I used it during my 12-week Data Science course at General Assembly.  My building has a Slack channel where residents receive updates regarding the building, a way to sell things, and invitations for get-togethers.  Slack is a way for people to connect - which means it can also be a way for job seekers to connect with hiring managers.  I'm part of several Slack channels (apart from GA and my apartment building) that are focused exclusively on all things related to Data Science.  Specifically, here are the Slack channels I've joined to stay connected to the Data Science community, and more specifically, to identify job opportunities:

[wimlds](https://wimlds.slack.com/) (Women in Machine Learning and Data Science)

[R-Ladies Community](https://rladies-community.slack.com/)

[Data Camp USA](https://datacamp-usa.slack.com/)

[NYCTech](https://nyctech.slack.com/)

Within each of these channels, there is a sub-channel dedicated to #jobs.  Yes, employers actually post real jobs in these channels and usually include the email handles of hiring managers.  It is not only ok but encouraged to email the poster directly to further inquire about opportunities that interest you.  Congrats, you just connected to a real live human for a real live job.

My list is by no means an exhaustive one, and [neither is this one](https://towardsdatascience.com/15-data-science-slack-communities-to-join-8fac301bd6ce).  These are just some of the channels that are out there related to data.  I would encourage you to do a little bit of research yourself to find a few Slack channels that would be good fits for you.  When trying to identify Slack channels to join, consider your stack, your location, and your demographic.  Connect with people who are similar to you and/or have similar interests.  Get the emotional buy-in from someone who actually wants to read your cover letter/email instead of a trying to be identifed as more than just a collection of words on a page among thousands of other words on a thousand other pages.

In my experience, bringing the human element back into the job search and connecting with even just one person is far more productive than throwing a hundred copies of your resume up in the air and hoping the wind blows it onto the desk of a recruiter who immediately recognizes your talents and worth.  And yes, I've taken my own advice: because of a connection I cultivated through a Slack channel I joined, I am in-process with a data-oriented company for a real live job.

### Start a Blog

Every job hunter has a resume and a LinkedIn profile.  For prospective employers, it can be difficult to actually gauge a candidate's technical ability based on self-reported bullet points.  To really give employers a better understanding of your Python prowess, start detailing your analyses in a blog.  This serves the twin purposes of not only demonstrating your code, but also proving that you can actually present your findings in an organized way.  Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that requires more than just technical know-how.  Depending on the firm, Data Scientists could be expected to support a number of different projects where they will be expected to report their findings to a range of technical and non-technical stakeholders.  Having the skills to communicate efficiently and organize your thoughts is just as important as slicing through a dataset with Pythonic prowess.  Don't be like everyone else -

purposes of starting a blog:
obvs shows your coding ability
shows you can organize thoughts
shows that you're generally interested in data beyond just getting paid
many competitive applicants are already doing this

### Hackathons

Continuing on in the vein of networking, attending a Hackathon is a great way to meet people.  I recently went to a SexTech Hackathon in Brooklyn which focused on leveraging technology to improve the sex lives of 8 billion people.  While I didn't have specific plans to break into the SexTech industry, it was a really great way to meet people from a variety of different backgrounds.  Teams were self-selected, and I ended up on a team comprised of a "humanitarian" (soft skills), a "hipster" (design), a "hustler" (business savvy), and another "hacker" (coding) besides me.  In just a day and a half, my team built a rudimentary chatbot decision tree in JavaScript (which I had never used before that weekend) designed to improve intimacy between couples.  To me and the other hacker, it mattered not what our inputs were, whether they were NSFW-related or about flowers - the code and the logic would be the same.  And while I did go just to improve my coding skills and to do a fun, crazy thing in Brooklyn for a weekend, I actually ended up connecting with the other hacker on my team who ended up referring me for a gig with her part-time employer to tutor Python to kids aged 8-10.  So really, you never know who you'll meet and how they might help you.  Keep an open mind and sign up for any hackathon that looks like it could be fun.  If nothing else, you'll have quite the story for Monday.
