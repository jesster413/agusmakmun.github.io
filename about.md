### About Me
---
Jess Chace is an experienced investigator in both public and private spheres with updated tech skills in programming languages (Python, Scala), relational databases (SQL, Git), exploratory data analysis, data enrichment, feature engineering, data modeling (regression and classification), machine learning (sklearn, imblearn), natural language processing (vectorization, sentiment analysis, gensim, Latent Dirichlet Allocation), web-scraping & APIs, image classification (keras, Tensorflow), big data (AWS, Spark), and data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Tableau).  She relies on a combination of programming skills, statistical analysis, data mining, machine learning, common sense, and instinct to identify and predict purpose-driven problems for government agencies and government-adjacent consulting firms.  You can download a copy of her resume [here]({{ "/download/Resume.zip" | thedatasleuth.github.io }}).

When Jess isn't modeling or visualizing her data, she likes to spend time with her dog and cat, read, cook new recipes, and practice her ukulele.

Jess graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Classics: Greek from Barnard College, Columbia University.  She boosted her career with a [12-week Data Science Immersive Course from General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive).
